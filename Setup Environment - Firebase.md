## Setting up Firebase

Log on to Google Firebase, Login using your credentials and visit the console page.https://console.firebase.google.com/

Create a new project, add necessary information to it and the services to opt for. Configuration of android app is easy using Android Studioâ€™s inherent support for
Firebase assistant. The Assistant can connect your existing project or create a new one for you with all the necessary gradle dependencies.
If you're using an older version of Android Studio or have a more complex project configuration, you can still manually add Firebase to your app.

**Use the Firebase Assistant**

To open the Firebase Assistant in Android Studio

- Click ```Tools > Firebase``` to open the ```Assistant``` window.
        
- Click to expand one of the listed features (for example, Analytics), then click the provided tutorial link (for example, Log an Analytics event).

- Click the ```Connect to Firebase``` button to connect to Firebase and add the necessary code to your app.

**Manually add Firebase**

To add Firebase to your app you'll need a Firebase project and a Firebase configuration file for your app.

**1.** Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console, if you don't already have one. If you already have an existing Google project associated with your mobile app, click **Import Google Project**. Otherwise, click **Add project**.

**2.** Click **Add Firebase to your Android app** and follow the setup steps. If you're importing an existing Google project, this may happen automatically and you can just download the config file.

**3.** When prompted, enter your app's package name. It's important to enter the package name your app is using; this can only be set when you add an app to your Firebase project.

**4.** At the end, you'll download a ```google-services.json``` file. You can download this file again at any time.

**5.** If you haven't done so already, copy this into your project's module folder, typically ```app/```.
